<p>Choosing a color palette for a visualization can be one of the most time consuming parts for perfectionists like me. It can be surprisingly difficult to decide on a palette that is both visually appealing and practical, but fortunately there do exist websites to help!</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://coolors.co/704e2e-79745c-e6f8b2-cde77f-709176">Coolors</a> shoots random, appealing, color palettes at you and you can swipe from one to the next with a hit of a space-bar.</p>
