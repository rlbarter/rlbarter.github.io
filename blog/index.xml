&lt;p&gt;superheat 0.1.0 is now available on CRAN. Superheat makes it easy to create extendable, cutomizable, and most importantly, beautiful heatmaps. It has increased flexibility and user-friendliness when compared to alternatives such as &lt;code&gt;heatmap()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pheatmap()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For usage options see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rlbarter.github.io/superheat/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vignette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and for examples see the accompanying &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01524&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;paper by Barter and Yu (2017)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install the latest version with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;superheat&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for new versions with added features and minor usability tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;example-usage&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage is straightforward and intuitive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(superheat)
set.seed(1347983)
selected.rows &amp;lt;- sample(1:nrow(mtcars), 10)
# add a space after the column names for aesthetic purposes
colnames(mtcars) &amp;lt;- paste0(colnames(mtcars), &amp;quot; &amp;quot;)

# plot the superheatmap
superheat(mtcars[selected.rows,], 
          # scale columns
          scale = T, 
          # label aesthetics
          left.label.size = 0.5,
          bottom.label.size = 0.15,
          bottom.label.text.angle = 90,
          bottom.label.text.alignment = &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;,
          bottom.label.col = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;,
          # dendrogram
          row.dendrogram = T,
          # top plot
          yt = sapply(mtcars, function(x) cor(x, mtcars$hp)),
          yt.plot.type = &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;,
          yt.axis.name = &amp;quot;correlation\nwith\nhorsepower&amp;quot;,
          # column order
          order.cols = order(sapply(mtcars, function(x) cor(x, mtcars$hp))),
          # grid lines
          grid.vline.col = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;,
          grid.hline.col = &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>How to Present Good</title>
      <link>/blog/2017-02-02-how-to-present-good/</link>

      <description>&lt;!-- BLOGDOWN-BODY-BEFORE

/BLOGDOWN-BODY-BEFORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I was asked to give a presentation on giving presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my lack of desire to spend time writing something that may have already been written by someone else led me to find a number of existing slides written by others with the same goal: to present on presenting. The only problem was that although these slides all contained excellent tips on making and subsequently presenting talks, the slides themselves were perfect examples of what &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do when making slides; they were insurmountable walls of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I would have to make my own slides after all. The final product can be found &lt;a href=&#34;../slides/presenting.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and is embedded below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cbwpLcEhHxz-FcMh99dlboBrXUDAIrzRJE7mu9uFmGU/embed?start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=5000&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; width=&#34;960&#34; height=&#34;569&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for a more in-depth glimpse into my presentation pro-tips&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;dedicate-a-lot-of-time&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dedicate a lot of time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making good slides takes time. You not only have to think about what you want to say, but also &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to say it, as well as how to arrange your slide so that it is not overwhelming yet still gets your point across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even making these fairly simple slides on presenting took me an hour and a half!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a quote by someone or other that says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every minute you speak an hour should be spent in preparation. So for a 60 minute seminar, one should work for 60 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is clearly excessive, the point is clear: making a good presentation will take time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;consider-your-audience&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consider your audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving the same presentation to vastly different groups of people is a definite no-no. For example, when I’m presenting to my biological collaborators, I need to simplify the technical details and can focus less on the biology background than when I’m presenting to my more data-literate peers. On the other hand, if I’m presenting to a lay-audience who is unfamiliar with both the technical details of the methods I’m using as well as the biology, I will remove all mathematical notation and stick to explanatory pictures that describe what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, statisticians tend to fill their slides with far too much math even for a technical audience. Even the most accomplished statisticians cannot absorb all that notation at once! Whenever possible, try to use annotated graphics in place of equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tip to try to tailor your talk to your audience is to ask the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much background does my audience have?&lt;/strong&gt; If they have a strong math background, I can assume that they know the basics and don’t need to explain them in excruciating detail, but if they don’t know any biology, I need to give a very simple explanation in lay-terms of the how the process works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it that I want my audience to take away from my presentation?&lt;/strong&gt; If I want them to be able to walk away and implement my method, I will give many more details, but if, as is more likely the case, I simply want them to have a broad understanding of why my project is important and how I’ve solved the problem at hand, then I can keep most of the details to myself and present a very high-level picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;tell-a-story&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tell a story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone enjoys a good story (but few people truly enjoy listening to a long, dry proof). Your talk should follow a structure as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The setup&lt;/strong&gt;: what is the context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue&lt;/strong&gt;: what was the problem that prompted your project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The resolution&lt;/strong&gt;: what steps did you take to solve the problem? What’s are the next steps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I am currently working on a project involving kidney transplants in HIV patients. My story is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The setup&lt;/strong&gt;: due to prolonged survival of HIV patients, additional complications including HIV-associated nephrology (kidney disease) are becomming more common resulting in an increased demand for kidney transplants among this population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue&lt;/strong&gt;: HIV-positive kidney transplant patients suffer from acute rejection of their transplanted kidney at a significantly higher rate than their HIV-negative counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The resolution&lt;/strong&gt;: we are developing models for predicting acute rejection in the hopes of elucidating the cause of this increased rejection rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;transition-slides&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transition slides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition slides are a great way to separate one part of your story from another. Their presence serves to indicate to the audience that you’re moving onto something new. They are particularly effective if your main content slides and your transition slides have different color templates. For example in the presentation above, the content slides have a white background and black text (with a blue heading), but the transition slides have a blue background with white text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stark difference between content and transition is an incredibly effective way to teach the audience that a blue slide with white text means that we’re moving onto something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outlines&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outlines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People really like outlines (that slide at the beginning of your talk that describes its contents). I happen to think outlines are great, it’s just that most people are terrible at making them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of a terrible outline is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literature review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that’s fairly useless. Of course your talk is going to begin with motivation, followed by a review of the literature, at which point you will move onto your contributions, show me some results and then conclude. This is the basic structure of every academic talk, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much better outline slide tells the audience what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are going to talk about, not the skeletal structure of a general presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, an outline for my kidney transplant project might look more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why HIV causes kidney disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outline of the UCSF Study&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cohort selection (and why we struggled with it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic approaches to predicting rejection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And why they don’t work well (yet…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;slide-contents&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slide contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;no-walls-of-text-please&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No walls of text please!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The golden rule of making presentations should be &lt;strong&gt;with text, less is always more&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a nice &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ted.com/10-tips-for-better-slide-decks/&#34;&gt;TED blog&lt;/a&gt; that has a nice paragraph discussing this point that I’m going to shamelessly drop here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to avoid—slides with a lot of text, especially if it’s a repeat of what you’re saying out loud. It’s like if you give a paper handout in a meeting—everyone’s head goes down and they read, rather than staying heads-up and listening. If there are a lot of words on your slide, you’re asking your audience to split their attention between what they’re reading and what they’re hearing. That’s really hard for a brain to do, and it compromises the effectiveness of both your slide text and your spoken words. If you can’t avoid having text-y slides, try to progressively reveal text (like unveiling bullet points one by one) as you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly like the point about how having a lot of text on your slides forces your audience to split their attention between reading and listening without achieving either goal successfully, because it’s &lt;em&gt;so true!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to realize that this holds true even if all of your text lives in bullet point format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;font-size&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Font size&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the worst (but incredibly common) mistakes that people make when preparing slides is tiny font size. Anything smaller than 18pt is way too small! This is equally (possible, even more) true for figures. Pro-tip: make the axis labels, legend and annotations &lt;span style=&#34;font-size:larger;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obnoxiously large&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;images&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images are a great way to lighten up your presentation. Try to find simple photos relevant to the point being made on the slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I recently made a presentation that included a section on “Weak learners”, which are basically a number of classification models that each individually perform poorly (at least a little better than random guessing), but when pooled together made a powerful learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I included an image alongside my description displaying an army of soldiers. Get it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53a05de869bedd95242e6b76-1200-667/meereen-army-game-of-thrones.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;army&#34; style=&#34;width:400px;height:350px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-to-write-the-presentation&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to write the presentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I usually encourage people to start their slide preparation with a structural skeleton by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start with your transition slides that indicate the distinct sections of your talk,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then add blank content slides with headers,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally fill in the content slides with content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, this isn’t quite what I do. While I will often start this way, as I start filling in the content, I will subsequently do a lot of moving things around, merging sections, and adding new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;repetition-for-emphasis&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Repetition for emphasis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is something that is really crucial to your story say it many, many times. Often in &lt;strong&gt;bold font&lt;/strong&gt; and in a &lt;font color=&#34;red&#34;&gt;different color&lt;/font&gt;. Say it in different ways, and keep coming back to it verbally: “remember that here we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have a control group, well blah blah blah”. Sometimes it’s okay to even tell your audience that you’re emphasizing something by saying something like “just in case it’s not obvious, I’m really trying to emphasize this point”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;presenting-your-results&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Presenting your results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a slide containing the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;#####../content/blog/2017-02-02-how-to-present-good_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this figure make you feel? Does it make you feel happy because of the pretty colors? Perhaps you’re just happy to see that the author used ggplot rather than base R plot…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I think this plot is a mess; the colors are distracting, the axis labels are useless, the text is way too small and the heading “Results” is entirely uninformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are many ways that we can make it better: we can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;universally increase the font size,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highlight our method in bold and blue, while fading the competing methods into the background by shading them in grey,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give the figure informative axis names,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make an informative slide header with the take-away message that “our method has lower prediction error than the competitors”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;#####../content/blog/2017-02-02-how-to-present-good_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more tips like this, I encourage you to check out Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic’s book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/book/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Storytelling with Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which I really enjoyed. It is a great read if you want to learn how to present your figures to maximize impact and to use your data to tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important step to presenting results is to treat the audience like idiots. Trust me, they’ll appreciate it (mostly becauase they won’t realize that you’re doing it). Explain in excruciating detail what every single element of your figure means. For example, in presenting the plot above, rather than simply saying &lt;em&gt;“this plot shows that our method clearly outperforms our competitors”&lt;/em&gt;, I would say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the figure on this slide, we are plotting the prediction &lt;em&gt;error&lt;/em&gt; rate over time. That means that the lower the error, the better. The x-axis depicts time, while the y-axis depicts the error rate at that time for each method reporesented by the three lines. Our method is highlighted in blue and we see that the error rate hovers around 10%, but that this is better than our competitors whose error rates tend to lie between 12 and 16% or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because your figure is obvious to you after having put a lot of thought into making the figure in the first place, that doesn’t mean that it is obvious to your audience who have viewed the figure for a total of 2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;presenting-many-plots-on-the-same-slide&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Presenting many plots on the same slide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen far to many presentations where the presenter moves to the next slide and, &lt;em&gt;BAM!&lt;/em&gt; - 10 plots that look almost identical are shoved in my face all at the same time. My brain subsequently has a meltdown and stops listening to a word the presenter is saying while I try to figure out what this army of plots is showing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple example that I found on the interwebs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://hlplab.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/balancedexx1prime-effect-byexperiment.png&#34; alt=&#34;army&#34; style=&#34;width:400px;height:350px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have to show a plot with many, many panels (perhaps from simulations under different paramter settings), then a much more effective way to present these results is to reveal them one-by-one, and explain what each plot shows as it is revealed, and how it compares to the previous plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;practice-makes-perfect&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practice makes perfect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the slides are made it’s time to practice, practice, practice! Practice by yourself to ensure that your timing is correct and to reduce the number of &lt;em&gt;“um”&lt;/em&gt;s and &lt;em&gt;“er”&lt;/em&gt;s as you present. Then practice in front of other people, preferably in front of an actual screen so that you can figure out where to stand (or sit), what to do with your hands (they always seem to be in the way), and how to point at things (with a laser pointer? using your mouse? with a big stick?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always a good idea to practice speaking slowly and clearly and to pause at each slide transition. Enthusiasm is encouraged - no one wants to listen to someone talk for an hour when &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; dont even sound excited about what they’re presenting. Varying the tone of your voice is very helpful with exuding an aura of enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eye contact is also vital. Why should your audience pay attention to you if you aren’t paying attention to them? If you are nervous, one idea is to pick a few spots in the back of the room, above people’s heads and look at those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, my greatest tip of all is to use humour, but only if you feel comfortable doing so (I actually find that using humour helps me relax). But it’s never a good idea to force it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Superheat: a simple example</title>

/BLOGDOWN-BODY-BEFORE --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making beautiful and customizable heatmaps just got way easier… Introducing the superheat R package!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using superheat, it is now extremely easy to produce plots like the example below describing 10 randomly selected cars from the famous &lt;code&gt;mtcars&lt;/code&gt; dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(superheat)
set.seed(1347983)
selected.rows &amp;lt;- sample(1:nrow(mtcars), 10)
X.col &amp;lt;- matrix(&amp;quot;black&amp;quot;, ncol = ncol(mtcars), nrow = 10)
X.col[scale(mtcars[selected.rows, ]) &amp;lt; 0] &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;white&amp;quot;
superheat(mtcars[selected.rows,], 
          # add text
          X.text = round(as.matrix(mtcars[selected.rows, ])),
          X.text.col = X.col,
          # scale columns
          scale = T,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Kellie Ottoboni, Rebecca Barter, Ryan Giordano, Sara Stoudt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, UC Berkeley experienced a series of high-profile sexual harassment incidents, prompting the graduate students in the Statistics Department to hold a roundtable event. While this response was initiated by overt sexual harassment, our discussion extended to other subtler gender biases. This article outlines the events that lead to the roundtable’s inception, the details of organizing and hosting the event, and our thoughts on what did and didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-situation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Situation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most high-profile incident involved &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/famous-astronomer-allegedly-sexually-harassed-students?utm_term=.eiZzwLkox#.daDAJnmxK&#34;&gt;Astronomy Professor Geoffrey Marcy, who was found in violation of campus policies&lt;/a&gt; after several women came forward accusing him of sexual harassment over the course of his tenure at UC Berkeley. To add insult to injury, upon uncovering details of the situation long before it became public, some claimed that the university mishandled the case by simply giving Marcy &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-abcarian-astronomer-resigns-20151019-column.html&#34;&gt;a metaphorical slap on the wrist&lt;/a&gt;. It was not until faculty in his department circulated an open letter of disapproval that Marcy finally stepped down from his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was becoming clear that sexual harassment was pervasive at all levels of the academic ladder and that such incidents were not being properly addressed or punished. While the campus scrambled to respond to the Marcy incident, several more stories received media attention: to name a few, an executive assistant at Berkeley Law &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/us/sexual-harassment-cases-tarnish-berkeleys-image-as-a-center-of-social-activism.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;accused the dean of the law school&lt;/a&gt; of inappropriately touching her and making her feel uncomfortable, for which he was found guilty; several undergraduate women came forward, stating that they sought help from various resources on campus after being sexually assaulted, only to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/26/uc-berkeley-rape-students-complaint_n_4855816.html&#34;&gt;dismissed and not taken seriously&lt;/a&gt; by the officials charged with protecting them; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailycal.org/2015/04/13/vice-chancellor-who-announced-resignation-thursday-denies-allegations-of-sexual-harassment/&#34;&gt;Vice Chancellor of Research resigned&lt;/a&gt; amid an investigation of alleged sexual harassment of a former employee. In fact, there have been reports of a whopping &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailycal.org/2016/04/06/in-past-seven-years-19-campus-employees-violated-sexual-harassment-policies/&#34;&gt;19 campus employees violating sexual harassment policies&lt;/a&gt; since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the scope of these offenses became public, the campus responded by creating new leadership roles to combat sexual harassment. However, many of these actions appeared only to signal that the campus was aware of the problem rather than directly providing support to students, faculty, and staff on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;initiating-the-rountable-event&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initiating the Rountable Event&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take tangible steps, the chair of the Statistics Department, Michael Jordan, asked the&lt;a href=&#34;http://sgsa.berkeley.edu&#34;&gt; Statistics Graduate Student Association (SGSA)&lt;/a&gt; to host a departmental event about these issues. The idea was to have a meeting for the students that was run by the students rather than a mandatory meeting held by an administrator. Professor Jordan’s suggestion was to center the meeting around “case studies” of gender bias and sexual harassment. Typical sexual harassment trainings exclusively feature case studies of behavior that are so obviously inappropriate that we felt that such scenarios offer little to discuss. Instead, we decided to focus the case studies on more common, yet subtler, experiences of implicit biases and gender-based discrimination. Furthermore, we thought that it would be more impactful if the scenarios we discussed were not fictional but were real stories from our colleagues. Most, if not all, women we know have experienced some form of gender biases or sexual harassment. We subsequently created a form for our colleagues to anonymously submit an anecdote describing a situation that they or someone who they know experienced. With a collection of anonymous stories, we could discuss case studies like is done in a typical sexual harassment training but could bring the discussion closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached out to several groups on campus for guidance on how to run the event in a way that would be not just useful and informative but would also encourage participation and open discussion of the issues. Maria Lucero-Padilla from the Office for Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD) generously shared many materials and guidelines with us in preparation for our discussion. She helped us identify themes among the case studies we collected and give structure to the conversation. We would like to thank her for her help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first gender biases roundtable discussion in 2015 was met with overwhelmingly positive responses, and we decided to repeat the event in 2016 with new case studies and new themes. However, we strongly believe that the conversation about gender issues is not over. By writing about our experience running this event, we hope to teach others holding similar events the lessons we learned and to get feedback on how to expand this program to encompass other types of diversity beyond gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;planning-and-running-the-roundtable-event&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Planning and Running the Roundtable Event&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-planning-committee&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The planning committee&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to emphasize that participation in such a discussion is important for both men and women, we decided to enlist members of both genders to help plan and run the meeting. A meeting run only by men runs the risk of being construed as condescending or “mansplaining,” whereas a meeting run only by women might make male attendees feel uncomfortable and attacked. We recognize that not all individuals identify with this gender binary; however, all participants from our department identified with one of these two genders, so we chose to draw this distinction when reflecting on participants’ roles and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;collecting-anecdotes&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Collecting anecdotes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first year, we circulated a call for submissions and a form to submit anonymous anecdotes to women in the Statistics Department and a limited number of people involved with diversity issues at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS). The second year, we circulated the form more widely to the entire Statistics Department and to all affiliates at BIDS. Both times, we received fewer than 10 submissions of stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they were submitted anonymously, it was apparent by the context of the stories that the responders were either postdoctoral scholars or faculty rather than PhD or MA students. There are a number of possible reasons for this: these more senior individuals have been in academia longer (especially during times when the workforce was a much more difficult place for women than it is today), have participated in a wider breadth of activities, have progressed through more stages of life, and have thus had more time to accumulate experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that female graduate students in our department chose not to submit anecdotes because they were anxious about sharing them either because they felt they’ll be judged or because the stories involved men in the department who participants might recognize. It is also possible that they really haven’t encountered any biases (or simply did not recognize such biases when faced with them), in which case statistics is a very special field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;choosing-anecdotes&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Choosing anecdotes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several common themes emerged in the gender bias anecdotes we received. Some stories observed competitions in which the woman was subtly undermined (e.g., when hiring new faculty). Several women described repeatedly being seen as the “token woman” (e.g., being asked about babies instead of about research or being the first woman ever hired in a department). Several anecdotes about sexual harassment involved status and power dynamics (e.g., students writing inappropriate comments to their GSI in evaluations and tensions between colleagues in the same lab).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose several anecdotes to discuss. In the first year, two were about implicit biases related to hiring decisions and one was about sexual harassment in a teaching role. In the second year, we used four anecdotes covering implicit bias, sexual harassment by a colleague, sexual harassment by a student, and the issue of getting senior leaders to value diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;during-the-event&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;During the event&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meetings lasted for about two hours and were held in the evening (from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m.) in order to minimize conflicts with class times. Professor Jordan kindly funded dinner in order to encourage attendance. Both years, we had around 16 attendees. The group was about three-quarters male, which reflects the gender ratio in the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began the meeting by explaining ground rules for the discussion (1. Focus on the statement, not the speaker; 2. Assume the best intentions of the speaker; 3. Listen and try not to feel personally attacked) and a short listening exercise in pairs, which set the tone of the discussion nicely. We found that because we set expectations for the discussion, people were more receptive to discussing uncomfortable topics and were ready to respectfully listen to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we talked about the anecdotes. During this portion of the meeting, we presented one case study at a time and asked the participants to form small groups of three to four in order to discuss the story for five minutes, providing them some guiding themes or questions. Afterwards, we invited volunteers from the groups to tell the whole room something interesting that they talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, both years, we concluded by asking the group what next steps the SGSA should take to grow its diversity and inclusion efforts in the future. After the first year, the question was whether people wanted to repeat such meetings in the future. The response was positive. After the second year, we asked about how we might expand the scope of such meetings to include other aspects of diversity beyond gender and how to include the entire department in larger discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we outline some of the main factors that we believe contributed to the success of the roundtable events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;small-group-discussions-are-a-good-way-to-encourage-participation&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Small group discussions are a good way to encourage participation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our observations, it looked like everyone in the small groups spoke to each other. When we brought the discussion back to the whole table, only a few outgoing people volunteered ideas. Forming small groups allows even the quietest people to participate because they don’t feel like the spotlight is on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be some need to informally “spread out” the women participants to various small groups so that each small group benefits from perspectives from both genders. Although we recognize that it can be difficult to be the lone representative of women in a group, the gender ratio of participants necessitated this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;individuals-enjoy-and-benefit-from-this-event-regardless-of-their-gender&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Individuals enjoy and benefit from this event regardless of their gender&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought hard about how to keep the discussion from being a rote affirmation of what we all already know are the social norms around sexism. There is a danger in these types of events that everyone goes through the motions that we know are expected of us without really gaining any new perspective on gender issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted the roundtable to be the kind of discussion that would allow people to express contradicting opinions and come in contact with genuinely different points of view. To facilitate this, we chose anecdotes that were relatively ambiguous incidents that might seem superficially minor but become problematic when viewed in the context of what women deal with in a sexist society. This both allowed participants to freely advocate for opinions that would not have been politically correct had the incidents been more serious and enabled women to share the many reasons why a seemingly innocuous incident could be hurtful or dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women often talk about such issues with each other but rarely with men. It is satisfying to have this conversation openly and have the opposite sex hear about the issues that women face. The case study submission format encourages this: everyone knows that these are real stories that have happened to people who we probably know and interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some feedback that we got from men who attended was that they liked having a venue to discuss gender issues candidly because they rarely have the opportunity. It is something they care about, but they do not know how to bring up the subject themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-event-works-well-when-the-participants-know-each-other&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The event works well when the participants know each other&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the timing of the event and group dynamics worked in our favor. The Statistics Department has around 50 PhD students, with eight to 12 per incoming cohort. Students take many of the same classes together during their first year, so they get to know each other well after several months. We held this event at the end of November. By this time, most of the new PhD students had met each other and were comfortable together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of familiarity lowered the barrier to having an open discussion about uncomfortable issues. Contrast this with the typical mandatory sexual harassment training, which often occurs at the beginning when someone joins a new program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a room full of strangers, we imagine that it would be much more difficult to candidly discuss subtle issues about gender bias. Thus, it is important to invite an intimate group of people to participate in such a roundtable discussion. Note, however, the converse of this statement is that given a different group of people, running an identical event might not go well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;participation-is-greatly-enhanced-by-encouragement-from-senior-faculty-members&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Participation is greatly enhanced by encouragement from senior faculty members&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside of having the discussion later on in the semester is that it often ends up being around “crunch time” for students. Email encouragements from both senior graduate students and the Department Chair as well as in-person discussion of the upcoming event at informal department gatherings helped boost the number who RSVP’d “yes.” In both years, a good mix of class years attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting volunteers to help lead future events is trickier. Participants agreed that future discussions should be extended to include broader themes of diversity, such as race, sexuality, and gender identity, but so far, nobody has volunteered to help organize a broader diversity discussion. The tension here is that the students currently leading the gender discussion (three Caucasian females and a Caucasian male) feel that they cannot speak to other aspects of diversity, yet actively targeting others to take on that role can be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps opening up the discussion to joint venues with representation from other departments would help increase the pool of those willing to take on facilitator roles at the expense of having a group that is less familiar with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;next-steps&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plan to continue holding this type of discussion at least once a year and expand the content to include all aspects of diversity. We hope to recruit additional leaders to help represent a broader base of diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions for how to move forward with these discussions or expand this program to other venues would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Pie charts are terrible&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pie charts are notoriously terrible for data visualization. Humans are genuinely bad at comparing angles. Thus, the only reason one should ever use a pie chart is to make beautiful pie-chart-art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c(&amp;#39;Sky&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Sunny side of pyramid&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Shady side of pyramid&amp;#39;),
  col = c(&amp;#39;#0292D8&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;#F7EA39&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;#C4B632&amp;#39;),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
