## Community



Spring 2017 **Founder and organizer**, [Practical Statistics](https://rlbarter.github.io/Practical-Statistics/)

- I founded and organized Practical Statistics: a group of graduate students, post-docs and research staff from the Statistics department, BIDS and D-Lab who meet to teach each other about statistical topics that are widely used in science, but rarely taught to statisticians.




2016/17 **Co-president**, [Statistics Graduate Student Association (SGSA)](http://sgsa.berkeley.edu/)

- Together with Kellie Ottoboni, I acted as the head of the graduate student body for the statistics department.
