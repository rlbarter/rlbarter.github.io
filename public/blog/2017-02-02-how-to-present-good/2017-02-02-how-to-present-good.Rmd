This week I was asked to give a presentaiton on giving presentations.

So meta.

Anyway, my lack of desire to spend time writing something that had already been written by somoene else led me to a number of existing slides written by others with the same goal: to present on presenting. The only problem was that, although these slides gave excellent tips on making slides and subsequently presenting them, the slides themselves were perfect examples of what *not* to do when making slides. The slides were insurmountable walls of text.

Sadly, I decided that I would have to make my own slides afterall. The slides themselves can be found [here](presenting.pdf)
