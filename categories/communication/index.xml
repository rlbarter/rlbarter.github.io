      <description>Choosing a color palette for a visualization can be one of the most time consuming parts for perfectionists like me. It can be surprisingly difficult to decide on a palette that is both visually appealing and practical, but fortunately there do exist websites to help!
For example, Coolors shoots random, appealing, color palettes at you and you can swipe from one to the next with a hit of a space-bar.</description>

      <title>Interactive visualization in R</title>

      <description>Last week I gave an SGSA seminar on interactive visualizations in R.
Here is a long-form version of the talk.
Why be interactive? Interactivity allows the viewer to engage with your data in ways impossible by static graphs. With an interactive plot, the viewer can zoom into the areas the care about, highlight the data points that are relevant to them and hide the information that isn’t.
Above all of that, making simple interactive plots are a sure-fire way to impress your coworkers!</description>

      <description>This week is the Docathon at BIDS (a.k.a. that wonderful place that I spend all my time).
A docathon is like a hackathon but is focused on developing material and tools for documentation. We have loads of projects signed up to receive some documentation-love and an impressive number of excited participants!
We kicked off the event with a series of tutorials for writing “good” documentation. I gave an R-specific tutorial where I discussed using devtools to both develop and document your package.</description>

      <title>How to Present Good</title>

      <description>This week I was asked to give a presentation on giving presentations.
So meta.
Anyway, my lack of desire to spend time writing something that may have already been written by someone else led me to find a number of existing slides written by others with the same goal: to present on presenting. The only problem was that although these slides all contained excellent tips on making and subsequently presenting talks, the slides themselves were perfect examples of what not to do when making slides; they were insurmountable walls of text.</description>
